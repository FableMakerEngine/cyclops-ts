# Cyclops

The game framework used by Fable Maker

## Development

- Clone the repository
  
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/LTNGames/pixi-game-base
```

- Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

- Run the development script to build and watch for changes

```sh
npm run dev
```

- Test the game

To test the game your best options is to use vscode or any IDE with a builtin nwjs launch/debugger.

We do have the proper `launch.json` in this repository so if you open up vscode and hit the debug play button, the game will run for you.
